While feeling the extreme speed, I can also appreciate the beautiful scenary of the nature. The snow on the ground is shinning in the sunshine, it was facinating and marvelous. This can really make me forget all my worries and let me enjoy the time of the moment to the fullest - the thirty seconds from the top to the bottom of the hill.

The dark night seems to symbolize the difficulties and obstacles I encountered. The mean words I received in my life are like the cold temperature that night. Even if the surrounding environment is not friendly to me, I will still do my best to bloom the most charming fireworks.
