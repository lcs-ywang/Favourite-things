Snowboarding is my favorite sport on the snow, each time of snowboarding makes me feel excited and passionate. Although I am not a professional snowboarder sor far, I will never stop practicing.
While I was descending from the top of the hill, the cold icy wind passed my face causing the loud howling in my ears. The freezing and a little bit of ache feeling on my face stimulated my senses. This kind of excitement made me feel passionate and energetic. I could even feel the floating of my blood inside my body while I am doing the snowboarding.
